After finally getting to the end of my Ruby studies, I had to come up with an idea for a Rails app for my porfolio. My brain was a little burned out between my full time job and the stress of my normal life, so the idea well had dried up.

My brain immediately turned to my go to stress relieve, video games. But instead of playing them as a distraction, I figured, might as well make my app about video games. I went to school for writing, and the old stand by is "write what you know". I guess that can apply to coding as well. Code what you know, I guess!

In order to make sure I hit all of the main requirements of the project, I wrote each one down on a sticky note and laid them out on my desk in front of my keyboard.  Each time I incorporated something, such as OmniAuth or a nested resource, I crossed off the item on the sticky note. It helped me keep track of what I was doing and also game me a sense of accomplishment and progress to keep me going.

GameView is still a very simple app. You can create a user account from scratch or authenticate via Facebook. You can add video games one by one and list them on your home page. You can change the status of each of your game from New to Playing to Beat. You can also review each game and have the review display on your home page. Each time you review a game, you get a GameView Level point. This gets updated and displayed on your homepage, a way of give the user a sense of achievement.

The part I struggled the most with was making sure nested resources worked properly. I had to make sure I was also passing the Game identification on into the Review Controller in order for all the routes to work properly.

The other main struggle I had that was less code specific is my obsession with how it looks. I used Bootstrap which also makes everything easier to put together. But if doesn't have any kind of formatting, it makes me feel like it's unfinished. So i probably spent way too much time tweaking formatting and had to stop myself. I could have spent a much longer time on formatting than I already did!

I am still not entirely thrilled behind the concept of this app, but I was trying to come up with something that displayed all the things I've learned in Ruby and in Rails through this course...which is a lot! Overall, I'm still very proud of what I have made and my ability to code a working website from scratch. I have also learned so much through the process and by reading through error codes. I'm starting to feel very confident in my abilities as a coder.
