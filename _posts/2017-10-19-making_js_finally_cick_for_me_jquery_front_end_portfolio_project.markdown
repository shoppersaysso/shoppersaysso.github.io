For many, this project was probably a breeze in comparison to the past projects. Not so for me.

This project required taking my last portfolio project app and appending some features with Jquery. Easy, right? I mean, I already had a complete, working application to start with. This should be a piece of cake!

Well...not so fast...

What I realized about my app during my project assessment was that...I hated it. I wanted to throw it out and never look at it again. I had started with a burnt out brain to make that idea and was not super happy with the outcome because I don't think the idea was that great.

Was I able to demonstrate what I had learned in the course thus far? Yes, I believe so. But was it a good app? Eh...

Having to revisit an application that had already fallen out of favor with me made it much more difficult to approach. It frustrated me. I spent some time cleaning up the application in Rails first (making some slight changes to the migrations and some of the pages) before implementing new code for it.

Once I got the app in a bit better shape (at least, one I was more comfortable with working with), I then forged ahead with writing Jquery.

Javascript has always been one of the more intitimidating languages for me to learn. It likely has to do with all the curly brackets and parantheses. There is a beautiful simplicity with Ruby when you don't have to deal with all that extra punctuation! Any time my script won't fire in Javascript, I know to double-check my brackets because I've likely forgotten one or duplicated another in the process of working out my code.

I realize this is a "me" problem: my frustration with it has proved to myself that I need to be a more cautious and more organized coder. This project forced me to be a neater coder and has definitely increased my ability to read error messages more productively. Now, Javascript doesn't seem so intimidating.
