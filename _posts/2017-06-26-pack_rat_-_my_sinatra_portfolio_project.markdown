I am a lover of all types of listsâ€”I make lists for everything to keep my lift organized, from shopping lists to task lists. Sometimes these lists are scrawled on a Post It note stuck to my display at work or in an app on my phone. I especially like to make lists when packing for trips. It may seem silly to write out specifically how many pairs of socks or what exact t-shirt I want to pack, but it helps me stay organized and also keeps me from over-packing. I pride myself in being a light, efficient packer who can get through airport security quickly.

My job occasionally requires me to travel to other countries for work, so making sure I have all my needd items is imperative because not everything you want is easy to find in a foreign country, especially when you don't speak the native language!

I decided to make a packing list app because, if anything, I knew it would be useful for my own life, as I'm already making tons of lists as it is.

Obviously, the first step was to establish user accounts to keep track of the various lists. I decided to add a privacy option as well, so you could make a packing list public in order to easily share it with someone you are traveling with (some people need a bit more help packing than others!). I wanted to make it so you could easily add and delete items.

But what's a good list if you can't mark things off of it? I personally, no matter how deeply invested into digital tech I get, still love physical lists. There's something satisfying about checking off an item on a list with the thick drawn line of a marker. This is why having an easy print option was a must have. Utilizing the Twitter Bootstrap framework, I added the "hidden-print" class to certain items on the page (such as the navigation bar, buttons, and images) so that they would not appear when printed. This yields in a clean and simple printed list.

I tried to customize the Twitter Bootstrap CSS files to get the look I wanted and utilized some free stock images from Pexels.com for some vacation inspiring photographs.  I probably spent too much time fiddling with the design and layout, but humans are such visual people that we tend to not want to use something if it's not visually appealing. 

Some things I'd like to do to make this app better include having a better collection of starter items for users to add, perhaps building those in a seed.db file for the database instead of having them added individually. It would also be nice to categorize items on the list for deeper organization.

I guess that's what new versions are for!
