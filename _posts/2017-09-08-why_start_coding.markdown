Many people start a program like this because they are looking to switch careers and get into the tech industry. They'd love to work for a leading company like Google or Amazon, or maybe a cool startup.

I already work in tech. I've been working in the tech industry for over ten years now. I work for a cool startup that was acquired by Alphabet. I manage a team of 16 engineers and recently received a promotion. So why spend the time and money on learning coding?

I work in tech support. While the rest of my company builds cool new products and tries to come up with solutions for smart city technology, I am managing a team of technical support representatives. Most of my time is spent allocating resrouces to projects and worrying about scheduling. I have to focus on how billable our time is and how utilized each team member is.

I've gone up the management chain which has taken my farther away from actual, hands-on technical work. I miss the days where I would spent hours trobleshooting a software issue or physically diassembling a computer to repair it.  While managament is often a lucrative step in the technical support game, it's also one that has left me bored and unchallenged.

I am interested in coding because I want to indulge my creative side as well as my technical side. I want to build and create, to have something tangible I can be proud of. I'm ready for the next new challenge in my career and I've decided I want it to be coding.
