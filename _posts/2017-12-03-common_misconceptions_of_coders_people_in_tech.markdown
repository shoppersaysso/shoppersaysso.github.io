I've worked over ten years in the technology industry, mainly in technical support. I started my career selling software part-time at the Apple Store before becoming a full-time Genius, repairing Apple products and providing technical support at the Genius Bar. After moving into corporate IT and then managing a team of 15 at a tech and design firm, I have finally ventured into coding.

When someone hears I work in technology, I find there are a lot of misconceptions of what that means I know and do.

In tech support, users often expect that you not only know how to troubleshoot every aspect of their computer and operating system, but also that you must be an seasoned expert in every piece of software as well. If I can reset your Active Directory password and set-up your email on your mobile device, then surely I must know every aspect of Adobe Photoshop and AutoCad as well.

In telling friends and family that I started coding, I now get a lot of "You should make a video game like that" or "Why don't you make an app that fixes this problem for me". While it's sweet to think of the confidence people must have in me to assume I can now code ANYTHING computer related after being in a coding program for less than a year, it's also amusing.

In the years of tech support I've worked, I've also found that people often think certain requests are very simple when in fact they are very complicated or impossible, while the converse is true as well. Often the requests that people assume are very complicated, sometimes to the point that they don't ask at all, are the ones that are very easy to complete.

I think with any field of expertise, not just technology, there is an awe around it by others, especially if you do not fully understand it. The same reason people may be frustrated that I don't know the answer to every technical question off the top of my head is the same as when people expect a doctor to instantly know the exact diagnosis to your health issues.

I don't think anyone has all of the answers and I think it's best to question yourself as you go, no matter how experienced you are in your field.
